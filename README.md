## change the app icon for the Flutter app, you can follow these steps:

Step 1:
Generate the desired app icon using a website like [App Icon Generator](https://www.appicon.co/#app-icon)

Step 2:
Once you have generated the icon, download the file and extract it. Inside the extracted folder, navigate to ```AppIcons.zip\android```, and copy all the files.

Step 3:
Paste the copied files into your Flutter app's android folder, specifically at: ```android\app\src\main\res```

Step 4:
Finally, re-run your Flutter app, and you should be able to see your new app icon.
